                            According to The Music Origins Project, “AfroBeat originated in Ghana in the 1920’s, where Ghanian musicians incorporated foxtrot and calypso to their rhythms. Around the late 1960’s a man by the name of Fela Kuti, also dubbed as the Father of AfroBeat would soon add his spice to it and later making it very popular amongst Nigerian youth from about 1970-1975. A true Pioneer.”
